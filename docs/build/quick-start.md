    **Project status: Clay testnet is now live.**</br>`Clay` is a decentralized public network ready for experimental application development and testing, but you still may encounter a few issues.  It is the last major milestone before `Fire` mainnet, which is under development and will launch in late Q1 2021. Documents published on Clay will *not* be portable to Fire. Please [reach out on Discord](https://chat.ceramic.network){:target="_blank"} or [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues){:target="_blank"} to report any issues. Read the full announcement [here](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/){:target="_blank"}.

# Quick start
Learn the basics by setting up and interacting with the Ceramic CLI. This tutorial serves as a simple introduction to Ceramic concepts. See [installation](./installation.md) to install Ceramic in your project and start building applications.

> **Want an even faster way to try Ceramic?** Visit the [Playground demo app](https://playground.ceramic.dev){:target="_blank"} to test the full stack of Ceramic components in the browser without needing to install anything.

## **Prerequisites**

This quick start guide will use a terminal, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="_blank"} v14, and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm){:target="_blank"} v6. Make sure to have these installed on your machine.

## **Install the CLI**

Install the Ceramic CLI using your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

## **Start the daemon**

Start a Ceramic daemon on your local machine and automatically connect to it on
port 7007, `http://localhost:7007`.

```bash
ceramic daemon
```

??? info "Node configurations"
    There are multiple options you can configure when you start the ceramic daemon.
    
    - **Network**: By default the CLI starts a Ceramic node on the `clay` testnet. If you
    would like to use a different Ceramic network, you can specify this with the
    `--network` option.
    - **Additional configurations**: Use the `ceramic daemon -h` command to see additional options.


## **Authentication**
By default, the Ceramic CLI is authenticated with a
[Key DID](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519){:target="_blank"}. The seed
for this DID is stored in `~/.ceramic/config.json`. If this file is not present
on startup a new DID will be randomly generated. It's currently not possible to
use the Ceramic CLI with other DID methods.


## **Create a document**
Use the `create` command to create a new document. In the example below
we create a document using the *tile* doctype.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic create tile --content '{ "Foo": "Bar" }'
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    DocID(kjzl6cwe1jw147ww5d8pswh1hjh686mut8v1br10dar8l9a3n1wf8z38l0bg8qa)
    {
        "Foo": "Bar"
    }
    ```

    !!! quote ""
        The first line of the output is the *DocID*, which is the persistent identifier of our newly created document. This DocID will be different for you, since you created it with your DID. Below the DocID is the current content of the document.

??? info "More options"
    
    - `--controllers`: set the *controller* of the document
    - `--schema`: set the *schema* of the document
    - Run `ceramic create -h` to see all available options

## **Query a document**
Use the `show` command to query the current state of a document. You will need to provide its *DocID*.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic show kjzl6cwe1jw147ww5d8pswh1hjh686mut8v1br10dar8l9a3n1wf8z38l0bg8qa
    ```
    
    !!! quote ""
        You should use your DocID instead of the DocID included here.

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    {
        "Foo": "Bar"
    }
    ```


Use the `state` command to query the entire state of a document.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic state kjzl6cwe1jw147ww5d8pswh1hjh686mut8v1br10dar8l9a3n1wf8z38l0bg8qa
    ```
    
    !!! quote ""
        You should use your DocID instead of the DocID included here.

=== "Output before anchor"

    ```bash
    {
      "doctype": "tile",
      "content": {
        "Foo": "Bar"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "schema": null,
        "controllers": [
          "did:key:z6MkfZ6S4NVVTEuts8o5xFzRMR8eC6Y1bngoBQNnXiCvhH8H"
        ]
      },
      "signature": 2,
      "anchorStatus": "PENDING",
      "log": [
        {
          "cid": "bagcqceranhr345kxf5gb3kwjvvnnefn2krqvhkpnurphqrn3lj773mfszmza",
          "type": 0
        }
      ],
      "anchorScheduledFor": "1/24/2021, 11:45:00 AM"
    }
    ```

    !!! quote ""
        Here we can see various information about the document such as *content*, *controllers*, and *schema*. In your output you should see your local DID as the controller, instead of the DID we show here. We can also see the current *anchorStatus* of our document, and that it has been scheduled to be anchored at 11:45 on the 24th of January 2021. Once this anchor is finalized, the state of the document will automatically be updated with a new entry in the log and *anchorStatus* will be set to `ANCHORED`.

=== "Output after anchor"

    ```bash
    {
      "doctype": "tile",
      "content": {
        "Foo": "Bar"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "schema": null,
        "controllers": [
          "did:key:z6MkfZ6S4NVVTEuts8o5xFzRMR8eC6Y1bngoBQNnXiCvhH8H"
        ]
      },
      "signature": 2,
      "anchorStatus": "ANCHORED",
      "log": [
        {
          "cid": "bagcqceranhr345kxf5gb3kwjvvnnefn2krqvhkpnurphqrn3lj773mfszmza",
          "type": 0
        },
        {
          "cid": "bafyreig6hostufw42cmz2cnn7hpvb6pau67a2n2syhzej7orqxfymdayyq",
          "type": 2
        }
      ],
      "anchorScheduledFor": null,
      "anchorProof": {
        "root": "bagcqceranhr345kxf5gb3kwjvvnnefn2krqvhkpnurphqrn3lj773mfszmza",
        "txHash": "bagjqcgza4xgkpjodtqtgyu2fx6rdr6fb6mhevd5hy4253tl6pjlssidpwaha",
        "chainId": "eip155:3",
        "blockNumber": 9527752,
        "blockTimestamp": 1611485094
      }
    }
    ```

    !!! quote ""
        This output was seen after the anchor has been created. The document state has now shifted *anchorStatus* to `ANCHORED`. You can also see that the log contains one more entry.

## **Update a document**
Use the `change` command to update a document. Your DID must be the controller of the document in order to update it.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic change kjzl6cwe1jw147ww5d8pswh1hjh686mut8v1br10dar8l9a3n1wf8z38l0bg8qa --content '{
        "Foo": "Baz"
      }'
    ```
    
    !!! quote ""
        You should use your DocID instead of the DocID included here.

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    {
      "Foo": "Baz"
    }
    ```

??? info "More options"
    Currently you can change *content*, *controllers*, and *schema* using the CLI. Run `ceramic change -h` for more information.


## **Create a schema**
In Ceramic you can enforce that documents adhere to a specified schema. The schemas themselves are Ceramic documents where the content is a [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/){:target="_blank"}. For example we can create a schema that requires a document to have a *title* and *message*.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic create tile --content ' {                                            
       "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
       "title": "Reward",
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "title": { "type": "string" },
         "message": { "type": "string" }
       },
       "required": [
         "message",
         "title"
       ]
     }'
    ```

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    DocID(kjzl6cwe1jw1472as4pj3b3ahqmkokbmwc7jchqcob6pcixcoo4kxq6ls8uuxgb)
    {
      "type": "object",
      "title": "Reward",
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "required": [
        "message",
        "title"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "message": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## **Create a document that uses a schema**
First, use the `commits` command to list the commitIDs contained in the schema document. When creating a document that uses this schema, we need to use a commitID instead of the DocID to enforce that we are using a specific version of the schema since the schema document is mutable and can be updated.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic commits kjzl6cwe1jw1472as4pj3b3ahqmkokbmwc7jchqcob6pcixcoo4kxq6ls8uuxgb
    ```
    
    !!! quote ""
        You should use your DocID instead of the DocID included here.

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    [
      "k3y52l7qbv1frxu8co1hjrivem5cj2oiqtytlku3e4vjo92l67fkkvu6ywuzfxvy8"
    ]
    ```


If a document contains multiple commits and you're not sure which one you want, use the `show` command to show the content of the document at the given commit.

Once you retrieve the desired commit, you can now create a document that is enforced to conform to this version of the schema. Use the `create` command and pass the `--schema` option along with your commitID.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic create tile --content '{
        "title": "My first document with schema",
        "message": "Hello World"
      }' --schema k3y52l7qbv1frxu8co1hjrivem5cj2oiqtytlku3e4vjo92l67fkkvu6ywuzfxvy8
    ```
    
    !!! quote ""
        You should use your commitID instead of the commitID included here.

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    DocID(kjzl6cwe1jw149tvfh6otqfzd2hfknkifb1z2lakozkicvau0xldzzdzwfbsztj)
    {
      "title": "My first document with schema",
      "message": "Hello World"
    }
    ```

## **Query the document you created**
Use the `state` command to query the state of the document we just created. We can see that the schema is set to the correct commitID.

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    $ ceramic state kjzl6cwe1jw14b5sr79heovz7fziz4dxcn8upx3bcesriloqcui137k6rq6g2mn
    ```
    
    !!! quote ""
        You should use your DocID instead of the DocID included here.

=== "Output"

    ```bash
    {
      "doctype": "tile",
      "content": {
        "title": "My first document with schema",
        "message": "Hello World"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "schema": "k3y52l7qbv1frxu8co1hjrivem5cj2oiqtytlku3e4vjo92l67fkkvu6ywuzfxvy8",
        "controllers": [
          "did:key:z6MkfZ6S4NVVTEuts8o5xFzRMR8eC6Y1bngoBQNnXiCvhH8H"
        ]
      },
      "signature": 2,
      "anchorStatus": "PENDING",
      "log": [
        {
          "cid": "bagcqcera5qxg5zabjjvwpcbia6c3t6vebgo4brgmsagxezdjgk4vxnzwb5hq",
          "type": 0
        }
      ],
      "anchorScheduledFor": "1/13/2021, 1:45:00 PM"
    }
    ```
